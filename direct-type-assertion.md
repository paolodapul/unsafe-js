The TypeScript error message:

> **"Conversion of type 'X' to type 'Y' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other."**

occurs when you attempt a **direct type assertion** between two types that have no overlap in their structure. TypeScript prevents unsafe casts unless you go through `unknown`, which effectively disables type safety.

### ðŸš¨ **Why does this happen?**
TypeScript uses **structural typing**, meaning types are compatible if their structures match. If two types (`X` and `Y`) **do not share any common properties or behaviors**, TypeScript assumes the conversion is an error.

This is most common in:
1. **Casting between primitive types (e.g., `string` to `number`)**
2. **Casting unrelated objects**
3. **Forcing incompatible types without `unknown`**
